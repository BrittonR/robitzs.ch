## about
Hey, I'm Britton Robitzsch. I'm interested in:

Software Engineering - Rust, Elixir, Nix, DevOpsy stuff, WebAssembly, etc

Homelabs - Home Assistant, Unraid, Plex

Photography - Currently my main camera is a Fujifilm X100v

Hobby Electronics - aka a box of Raspberry Pis and ESP-32s

Cars - mostly Toyota Landcruisers and Porsches

I'm currently a freelance software engineer based in Denver, CO. In my spare time I enjoy working on side projects, hiking and camping, and working on my vehicles.
