#### ::Report: Shifting the focus towards preventative healthcare measures in Nepal::

Healthcare in Nepal is in a state of crisis. The country faces many challenges, including a high burden of communicable diseases, a lack of access to quality care, and a lack of trained healthcare personnel.

In recent years, the government of Nepal has made some progress in addressing these problems, but much more needs to be done. One of the most effective ways to improve the health of the population is to focus on preventative measures.

Preventative measures are cheaper and more effective than treating the issues caused by lifestyle choices that lead to diseases like cancer and diabetes. For example, lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and eating a healthy diet can significantly reduce the risk of these diseases.

Additionally, campaigns that raise awareness about the importance of preventative measures can also be effective in reducing the burden of these diseases. The government of Nepal should therefore focus on both improving access to quality healthcare and promoting preventative measures.

#### Case Study:

Diane is a 56-year-old woman who was diagnosed with diabetes. She has been managing her diabetes with medication and lifestyle changes, but her disease has progressed and she now requires insulin therapy. The cost of her insulin and diabetes supplies is $100 per month. In addition, she has been diagnosed with hypertension and high cholesterol, which requires additional medications. Her monthly healthcare costs are $400.

These are both subsidised by the state which takes on an even higher cost at over $10,000 a year.

By increasing awareness of diabetes and offering incentives and support to maintain a healthy lifestyle, more people may be motivated to make lifestyle changes that can reduce their risk of developing the disease. In addition, public health messages may also promote early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes, which can improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.

#### Recommended Actions

Based on our research, we recommend that the following actions are taken to improve the current state of public healthcare:

1. Improve access to healthcare in rural and remote areas.
2. Increase funding for public health initiatives.
3. Expand and improve health awareness campaigns.
4. Improve access to quality medical supplies and equipment.
5. Increase access to skilled medical personnel.
